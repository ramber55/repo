* IMPLEMENTED ENDPOINTS
All the Basic and Medium Level endpoints have been implemented.

/listSpecies - By default, ensembl returns an unordered species list and the order of that list
seems to change each time it is requested. That makes that if you take just a number of species (according
to the provided "limit" value), the content of the resulting list is each time different although the
same "limit" was specified. To prevent this behaviour, the list returned by ensembl is ordered and,
afterthat, processed to take the first "limit" species. This way, each time a given limit value is
specified the same species list is returned and, to get a different list, a different "limit" value must be
specified.

/geneList - if for a returned gene no external_name is found in the answer, its id is taken instead.


* IMPLEMENTED INTERFACES
All the endpoints are provided through both interfaces: HTML and Rest (same URL as for HTML request but with
parameter json=1).

* ERROR MANAGEMENT
Errors messages are shown in a html page (for html requests) or json messages (for rest requests).

Following errors are managed through both interfaces (html and rest) providing meaningful info:
- Wrong page/endpoint requested.
- Absence of mandatory input parameters (as species in /karyotype, species and chromo in /chromosomeLength, ...)
- Right syntax in input parameters (as for limit in listSpecies, start and end in geneList,...)
- Right chromo provided in /geneList (it must be a human chromosome)
- end-start (base positions) difference greater than the maximum allowed range of 5.000.000 bases in /geneList.
- Communication Problems with Ensembl server
- File Not found error for html files.
- species not found by ensembl in /karyotype
- species or chromosome not found by ensembl in /chromosomeLength
- gene not found by ensembl in /geneSeq, /geneInfo and /geneCalc

To improve:
The system always return 200 OK in the HTTP GET response even when an error has been detected. As the
info about the error is shown in the html page and returned in the rest json response, it was assumed that
could be enough. However, it has been observed now (no time to fix it) that when Ensembl detects an error
it returns error info but also answers with 400 Bad Request. In the same way, commercial html systems, when
an error happens show an error page but also with 400 or similar.

The error message that Ensembl returns in case of error is not taken from the answer to be showed to the
user or to be returned in the rest response and it could be very useful. Instead of that it is tried to map
ensembl errors with the expectable errors. However that may return wrong error messages (just one case dectected:
in /geneList if MT is specified as chromo and wrong start, end values are provided, the system returns that MT
was not a valid human chromosome although ensemble returns something like "wrong slice for MT ...").
